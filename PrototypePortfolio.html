        <h2>Advertising & Graphic Design - Creative/Student/Artist</h2>

        <p>"As an artist, I do specialize in creating artwork and even sculptures as well! As an educator, I focus primarily on teaching people how to organize their own paintings: Making them come to life!" Working my magic from apparel mockups, to the labelled package design I've created: I intend to make great leaps forward to support my client’s creative vision.</p>
        <p>I’m exploring creative pursuits everyday as I'm designing portfolio pieces. Day by day, I take up a tremendous amount of effort towards honing my artistic discipline, bettering the level of professionalism & efficiency I’d like to attain within my new career as a
          freelancing graphics & illustrations artist! <a href="http://mtv.com" target="_blank">Nightside Skateboard Deck & Paintings</a>, an online store I’m running nowadays!"</p><br>

          <h3>Alternating Inkblot Artwork (Physical Book Covers + Digital Audiobook Covers)</h3>
          <p>For my case study, I chose to display up to three (3) books with
            alternate covers I was able to digitally craft into newer renditions of the corresponding artists’ works of literature. However my creation is primarily red, black, and white; in a culmination of this bruting color scheme that resulted.

          <h3>Axe Anonymous Guitar Repair & Retail (“Building a Website in a Week”) – Website Page Design Spreads</h3>
          <p>Initially, I spent time digitally altering previous inkblot artworks of mine for the sole purpose of imagining a different book cover for my favorite authors. Though I did struggle to enact any other background images for my final LOTF book cover.</p>

          <h3>Jump Start Coffee
            Biodegradable Paper Coffee Labels, Cups, and Coasters</h3>
            <p> I’d absolutely hold art centric workshops to help create an access point for a target audience to create personal artwork. Appearing at a book convention, this rendition could convey alternate book covers as personal artwork (as well as Audiobook covers) created for podcast listeners unable to attend on the day of the book convention events. <br>
